## Solution Process
Opening the website by followingt the link leads us to a barebones login page. On inspecting
the Javascript, we seee this code::

```
(async()=>{
    await new Promise((e=>window.addEventListener("load", e))),
    document.querySelector("form").addEventListener("submit", (e=>{
        e.preventDefault();
        const r = {
            u: "input[name=username]",
            p: "input[name=password]"
        }
          , t = {};
        for (const e in r)
            t[e] = btoa(document.querySelector(r[e]).value).replace(/=/g, "");
        return "YWRtaW4" !== t.u ? alert("Incorrect Username") : "cGljb0NURns1M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyXzUzcnYzcl81M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyfQ" !== t.p ? alert("Incorrect Password") : void alert(`Correct Password! Your flag is ${atob(t.p)}.`)
    }
    ))
}
)();
```

The JS clearly reveals the username and password, but the string given are what the password and username become after base64 encoding, as indicated by the `btoa()` function used. So, to get the username and password that should be inputted, we simply decode them. 

The decoded password *is* the flag. (Clicking submit with these credentials leads to a popup with the flag; the flag is the same.)
