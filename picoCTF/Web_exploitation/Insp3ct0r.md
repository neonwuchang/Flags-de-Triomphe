## Description
Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44924/ 
or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:44924

## Solution process
Taking the hint fromm the description, we inspect the source code and make the following discovies:
- In the HTML file, we find: `<!-- Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 -->`
- In the CSS file, we find : `/* You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t */`
- In the JS file, we find: `/* Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?f10be399} */`

Next, we simply put it all together to get the flag!

*Note: For a similar challenge with slightly greater difficulty, refer [Scavenger_hunt]().*

(Unfortunately, or fortunately, I solved Scavenger_hunt before attempting this challenge, which made this challenge
extremely easy, not that it wasn't already hehe.)
