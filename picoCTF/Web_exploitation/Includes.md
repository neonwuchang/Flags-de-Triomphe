## Solution process
Clicking the link leads us to this page:

The content on the website suggests that we should inspect the code. 
Clicking the `say hello` button results in a popup,which once again suggests to us tat we need to inspect the code.

So, we do exactly that. We find the first half of the flag in the file `style.css` and we find the second half of the flag
in the `script.js` file. We put the two halves together and we're done.

- First half: `picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_`
- Second half: `f7w_2of2_6edef411}`
