## Description
The one time pad can be cryptographically secure, but not when you know the key.
Can you solve this? We've given you the encrypted flag, key, and a table to help UFJKXQZQUNB 
with the key of SOLVECRYPTO. Can you use this table to solve it?.

## Solution processor
Here, we have everything: the ciphertext, the key, and a table.

We *could*, as the description suggests, use the table and get some practice at breaking the one time pad
, *or*, we could work smart and use of one of the many available tools to decrypt it and get the value to put 
in the flag as: `picoCTF{PLAINTEXT}`.
