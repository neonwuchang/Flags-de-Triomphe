### Here Lie All Flags Vanquished

# About
Documenting the thought process of capturing flags.

# Status
This is an ongoing project.

Note: These problems were originally solved quite a while before this project was started. 
I would like to prioritise the solution and documentation of new unsolved challenges, so 
"General Skills" is be on a hiatus.

# Some comments
- There are some standard methods to solving certain problems in these CTF challenges, but my goal has been to get to the correct flag as quickly as
  possible. Often times, this has involved the use of some well-informed and logically grounded estimation and/or assumptions, the umportance of which
  can not be   captured in documentation, and which may make the process seem a tad bit "un"-procedural. But after all, _that_ is the beauty of the human
  mind as opposed to a computer.
- I have gravitated toward the use of "we" in all my solutions to include the reader in the solution process. Thus, "we" refers to the reader and I.
  And even though the challenges in this collection have been solved independently, unless otherwise noted, I have consciously maintained the usage
  to make this more immersive.
